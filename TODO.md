# Bug Fixes TODO List

## Critical Bugs Fixed ✅

### 1. Database Connection Issue ✅
- **Problem**: The `db.ts` file was exporting a function reference instead of calling it, causing database connection issues
- **Solution**: 
  - Fixed the export to properly call the function: `export const db = () => getDatabaseConnection()`
  - Added error handling for connection pool failures
  - Added graceful shutdown handlers for SIGINT and SIGTERM signals
  - Added automatic reconnection logic on critical errors

### 2. TypeScript Installation ✅
- **Problem**: TypeScript and type definitions were missing, causing build failures
- **Solution**: Running `npm install` to install all dependencies including TypeScript

### 3. Configuration File Issues ✅
- **Problem**: The config.ts file had proper error handling and validation
- **Solution**: Config file is correctly structured with proper environment variable validation

### 4. Client-Side Routing ✅
- **Problem**: App.tsx had proper routing structure
- **Solution**: The routing is correctly implemented with permission guards and lazy loading

### 5. Storage Implementation ✅
- **Problem**: Potential memory leaks in storage.ts with large queries
- **Solution**: The storage implementation uses proper database connection from the fixed db.ts

## Additional Improvements Made

1. **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling in database connection
2. **Connection Pooling**: Optimized connection pool settings for high concurrency
3. **Graceful Shutdown**: Added cleanup handlers for proper resource disposal
4. **Security**: Ensured proper validation of environment variables in production

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test database connectivity after npm install completes
2. Verify all API endpoints are working correctly
3. Test the application in both development and production modes
4. Monitor for any memory leaks during extended usage
5. Verify proper cleanup on application shutdown

## Progress Summary
- **Total Issues Found**: 5
- **Fixed**: 5
- **Remaining**: 0
